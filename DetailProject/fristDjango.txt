 Tutorial Overview
1.installing & Enviroment setup(for intstalling django we use=> pip install django  
       to check version we use => python -m django --version
        for creating a django project=> django-admin startproject (your project name)
        to run python project use => python manage.py runserver  )

        # their is request is done by user  so 1st url.py is in used 
           then their path is call by first importing 
           ( this is for the static rendering for simple project complex for debugging for big project)
          1.1) from django.http import HttpResponse #( here we import HttpResponse from django.http)
          2.2) create function as =>def index(request):
                                        return HttpResponse(" its me krishna) // this is the out i.e Its me krishna

                            urlpattern=[
                                 path('admin/', admin.site.urls), ( this is intially present  )
                                   path('',index) // this say this is the first http://127.0.0.1:8000/
                            ]

         # for the big project we create the app layer to modify /manage things  and deal with also databases and render through templete
           1.1) for creating app we use => python manage.py startapp (your app name)
                and then go to the views.py  to create the another http request by using :
                                         def employee(request):   or( your app name)
                                        return HttpResponse(" its me employee ")

            2.2) after go to main empsys or main projectname file and then go to Url.py wher http request handle
                       and ther set the urlpattern just by importing  function name employee with http HttpResponse
                           i.e =>   from Employee.views import Employee  here this say that Employee is a floder name which i 
                                    already make and then views is the python file where  Http request response is writeeen

                                    finally here also set the urlpattern path=>
                            urlpattern=[
                                 path('admin/', admin.site.urls), ( this is intially present  )
                                 path('',index), // this say this is the first http://127.0.0.1:8000/
                                 path('employee', employee)  //here def employee is called  and return the its me employee 
                                                             // in a http://127.0.0.1:8000/employee
                            ]
