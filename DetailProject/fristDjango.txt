     1)days 
     (for intstalling django we use=> pip install django  
       to check version we use => python -m django --version
        for creating a django project=> django-admin startproject (your project name)
        to run python project use => python manage.py runserver  )

        # their is request is done by user  so 1st url.py is in used 
           then their path is call by first importing 
           ( this is for the static rendering for simple project complex for debugging for big project)
          1.1) from django.http import HttpResponse #( here we import HttpResponse from django.http)
          2.2) create function as =>def index(request):
                                        return HttpResponse(" its me krishna) // this is the out i.e Its me krishna

                            urlpattern=[
                                 path('admin/', admin.site.urls), ( this is intially present  )
                                   path('',index) // this say this is the first http://127.0.0.1:8000/
                            ]

         # for the big project we create the app layer to modify /manage things  and deal with also databases and render through templete
           1.1) for creating app we use => python manage.py startapp (your app name)
                and then go to the views.py  to create the another http request by using :
                                         def employee(request):   or( your app name)
                                        return HttpResponse(" its me employee ")

            2.2) after go to main empsys or main projectname file and then go to Url.py wher http request handle
                       and ther set the urlpattern just by importing  function name employee with http HttpResponse
                           i.e =>   from Employee.views import Employee  here this say that Employee is a floder name which i 
                                    already make and then views is the python file where  Http request response is writeeen

                                    finally here also set the urlpattern path=>
                            urlpattern=[
                                 path('admin/', admin.site.urls), ( this is intially present  )
                                 path('',index), // this say this is the first http://127.0.0.1:8000/
                                 path('employee', employee)  //here def employee is called  and return the its me employee 
                                                             // in a http://127.0.0.1:8000/employee
                            ]
                                   

     2)days(templete concepts ). tempelete directory set in setting.py
                      but by default  App vitra template hunxa tyo detail setting.py ma hunxa
                      Here  App is Employee . Templete i.e visible to the user

                      so, here i create a Templete folder inside the Employee (i.e App)
                         if i create  file eg. index.html insder that Templete folder  
                         so, setting.py vitra ko Dir ma manage hunxa 
                          templete haru handle Garna => render function use hunxa
                           

                           and render function take different argument i.e(request,template_name, other are optional)

                           so , i create a index.html inside templete folder then , i.e html file  we all know
                           that templete folder is inside the Employee folder so inside Employee  in a view.py 
                           then, we create this\
                                              => def index(request):
                                               return render(request,'index.html') after that

                            we that we go empsys to the url.py and import by doing this
                                                  =>from Employee.views import employee,index
                                                 we already set the path urlpattern before so need
                                                 to change
                             and for proper run  we go to  empsys setting.py  =>
                                                                       INSTALLED_APPS=['index.html',]
                              then finally run.
                         
                          if we create app inside tempate no need to set path  but 
                          outside the app  we create tempate then we this the directory in settings.py as     eg inside Templete in 'DIRS': [BASE_DIR,'Templete'],
                            
                            then if we use templete inherent or 
                             navigate fix then we use 
                                          {% block main %}
                                         <div class="container"> 
                                             <h1>this is the home page</h1></div>
                                             {% endblock %} this is on main page.

                         inside the other  we us    we write this like 
                                                           
                                                           {% extends "base.html" %} {% block main %}
                                                              <div class="container">
                                                                 <h1> this is employee page</h1>
                                                              </div>
                                                             {% endblock %}
